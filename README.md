# Job Application Tracker

## Why This Project Exists

Landing an internship requires juggling dozens of contacts, deadlines, follow-ups, and interviews. I needed a tool that keeps everything organized and actionable in one place, so I built this application to manage my outreach with clarity. To accelerate the process and keep the codebase clean, I partnered with **Codex**, an AI coding assistant that helps me iterate quickly, explore implementation ideas, and maintain the code quality while I practice building full-stack features.

## What Codex Brings To The Table

- Speeds up feature scaffolding so I can focus on user experience.
- Suggests clean code patterns.
- Acts as a sparring partner while I learn to ship complete, professional-grade apps at a faster pace.

## Capabilities

- Track every internship or job application with company, role, location, priority, next actions, and notes.
- View key metrics (total applications, interviews/offers, in-progress items, and refusals) at a glance.
- Filter the pipeline by status, priority, and application type, and search by company, role, or location.
- Add, edit, and delete applications through an intuitive UI with visual cues based on priority and status.
- Persist sensible defaults for newly created entries to speed up data entry.
- Keep the pipeline across refreshes with browser-based persistence powered by localStorage.

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** with functional components and hooks for state management.
- **Vite** for fast development server and bundling.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling.
- **Lucide-react** for consistent iconography.
- **localStorage** for lightweight persistence without a backend.

## Data Storage

Every change to the pipeline is serialized to the browser‚Äôs `localStorage` under a dedicated key. On a first visit, the app seeds sample applications so you always see a populated interface; afterwards, edits, additions, and deletions overwrite that store so your data survives refreshes and restarts with zero backend setup.

**Good practice:** export your tracker data before you leave the application so you always keep an offline Excel backup of your candidatures. 
If the browser ever clears `localStorage` or something unexpected happens, you can now import that spreadsheet back into the app and recover the full history in seconds.

## Reuse This Project
