# 📌 Job Application Tracker

## ❓ Why This Project Exists
Landing an internship requires juggling dozens of contacts, deadlines, follow-ups and interviews.  
I needed a tool that keeps everything organized and actionable in one place.  
I built this application to manage my outreach with clarity.  

To accelerate the process and keep the codebase clean, I partnered with **Codex**, an AI coding assistant that helps me iterate quickly, explore implementation ideas, and maintain the code quality while I practice building full-stack features.

## ⚡ What Codex Brings To The Table
- Speeds up feature scaffolding so I can focus on user experience.  
- Suggests solid code patterns.  
- Acts as a sparring partner while I learn to ship complete, professional-grade apps at a faster pace.  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack
- React 19 with functional components and hooks for state management.  
- Vite for fast development server and bundling.  
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.  
- Lucide-react for consistent icons.  
- localStorage for lightweight persistence without a backend.

## 💾 Data Storage
Every change to the pipeline is serialized to the browser’s **localStorage** under a dedicated key.  

On first visit → pre-seeded sample applications.  
Afterwards → edits, additions, deletions are persisted.  
Excel export → always keep an offline backup.  

If localStorage ever resets, simply **import the Excel backup** and recover your data in seconds.
